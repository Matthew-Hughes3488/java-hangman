# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman Game, a simple Java implementation of the classic word-guessing game played in the terminal. 
This project serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, 
focusing on creating maintainable and extendable code through the use of interfaces to achieve loosely coupled classes.
